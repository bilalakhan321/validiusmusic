Initially the design on the application was made without the service layer.

I intentionally had not added this layer as it didn't seem necessary at the time of designing.
All the CRUD operations were specifically being handled at controller level.

During testing phase it was quickly realized that there is added benefit to seperate controller http functions
and CRUD operation specific to business logic.

As many of the code was shifted to service layer, you will see additional of http verbs which should be ommitted
at a later date.
