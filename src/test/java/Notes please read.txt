For testing repositories, I created a seperate embedded test empty H2 database.
I was hoping to apply this method for Service layer but wasn't successful. Properties have been setup
in application.properties found in src/test/resources folder

I was hoping to apply the empty database to service layer but was unable to successfully create bean.
Instead for service layer I used Mockito Framework to mock data.
